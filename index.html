						<h3>Techie historian brings her IT company back home to Maine</h3>
						<p>
						BANGOR, Maine - After having lived, studied and worked in such faraway places as Dublin, Edinburgh, Boston, San Francisco, Washington, D.C. and Chicago, a historian turned techie who grew up in Maine is making her way back home - and taking a piece of the business she founded with her. <br/><br/>Kristen Gwinn-Becker, formerly of Levant, said earlier this month that she's returning because her company, HistoryIT, is growing and she wants to bring business back to the state, as well as to "return to living the way life should be."
